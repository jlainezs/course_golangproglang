# Hands-on exercise #5

We are going to learn about testing next. For this exercise, take a moment and see how much
you can figure out about testing by reading the [testing documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) & also Caleb Doxseyâ€™s
article on testing (link doesn't work). See if you can get a basic example of testing working.

Note: go test raises an error. Applying [this patch](https://appliedgo.net/testmain/) works, but is somewhat strange.

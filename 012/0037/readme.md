# Exercise 37

- use the code from the previous exercise
- add this code to print a single value stored in the map
```
age := m["James"]
fmt.Println(age)
```
- now use similar code to use the lookup of "Q" and print that value
- now use the "comma ok" idiom to test whether "Q" is actually stored in the map, then
print out a statement if it is not stored in the map
  - hint: check [effective go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) for the "comma ok" idiom

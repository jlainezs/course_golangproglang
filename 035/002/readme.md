# Hands-on exercise #2
Start with [this code](https://github.com/GoesToEleven/go-programming/tree/master/code_samples/010-ninja-level-thirteen/02/01-code-starting). Get the code ready to BET on (add benchmarks, examples, tests) however
do not write an example for the func that returns a map; and only write a test for it as an extra
challenge. Add documentation to the code. Run the following in this order:

- tests
- benchmarks
- coverage
- coverage shown in web browser
